The Movistar Open moved to Santiago from Viña del Mar in 2010. It is the first clay-court tournament of the ATP World Tour season and also the opening leg of the four-tournament swing through Latin America, aptly coined the "Golden Swing" in honour of top Chileans and Olympic Gold medalists Fernando Gonsales and Nicolas Massu. Gonzalez is a four-time champion.
