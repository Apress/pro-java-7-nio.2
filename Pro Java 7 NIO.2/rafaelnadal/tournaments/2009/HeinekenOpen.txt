The Pride Of New Zealand
The Heineken Open is the biggest men’s professional sporting event in New Zealand, held in Auckland since 1956. Played in the week prior to the Australian Open, the ATP World Tour 250 event is a crucial stop in preparation for the year's first Grand Slam tournament. John Isner won the Auckland title in 2010, and went on to reach the Melbourne fourth round for the first time.
